# LDP-Jaccard

Implementation of local differential private minhash variants to estimate the Jaccard similarity. 
Details can be found in [our manuscript](http://itu.dk/people/maau/additional/ldp-jaccard.pdf).

The experimental notebook is `log.ipynb`, all code can be found in `src/`. The evaluation needs jupyter notebook, pandas and seaborn.

If you want to use the hashing methods in other contexts, just see example usage 
the `src/run_{synthetic,realworld}.py`.
