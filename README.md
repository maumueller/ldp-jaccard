# LDP-Jaccard

Implementation of local differential private minhash variants to estimate the Jaccard similarity. 
Details can be found in [our manuscript](http://itu.dk/people/maau/additional/ldp-minhash.pdf).

The experimental notebook is `log.ipynb`, all code can be found in `src/`. Requires pandas, seaborn, and pandas to be installed. 
Details about how to run the code are in the notebook.

If you want to use the hashing methods in other contexts, just see example usage 
the `src/exp_{real_world,artificial}.py`.
